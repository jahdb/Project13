project 13 challenges

The repository was created for Project 13. I was assigned to Create a GitHub repository with 3 folders. Each folder was created for the platforms LeetCode, Hackerrank, and CodeWars. 
I was to work on 2 - 3 beginner-level challenges from any of the platforms. I decided to work on challenges from Leetcode and Codewars.
